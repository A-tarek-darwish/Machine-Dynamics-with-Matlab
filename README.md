Machine Dynamics with MATLAB

This project comprises of six milestones, that cover the exercises that I have finished during a course from RWTH Aachen. 
The exercises were given by Msc Martin Lankers (martin.lankers.de) and a solution was provided after the work was completed 
to make sure that my solution is correct. 
A brief description of the code is available on the first line of each file. 
This project covers the full process of modeling the motion of a vehicle, any forced excitations and the road conditions were also put into consideration. 
There is also an animation available as a representation for the work done using both MATLAB and Simulink.
